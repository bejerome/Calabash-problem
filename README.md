# Calabash Problem set

## Objectives:
* Use the Page Object Model in Calabash to create your solution
* Create a class which aligns to the “Knowns” below which has the proper includes added into it
* Develop an iOS and Android Calabash method in a utility rb file to support the selection of values in the 2 picker objects above
* Create a custom step to permit the user to select a value for both pickers
* Create a feature file containing a scenario that would select a value for each picker
* Create a step in the feature file which would validate the value selected (please do not used any Calabash Pre-Defined Steps)


## Knowns:

* Picker objects are uniquely named
* The name of the screen these hypothetical pickers appear on is called the “Select a Value” screen
* The picker objects are only used to pick numbers
* The pickers are using the default picker classes in iOS and Android
* Both pickers have a “Set, Cancel, and Clear” button (although not currently visible in picker_2 just pretend its there when building the pseudo code)
* After selecting a value in the picker,  when the picker disappears in this hypothetical application,  it will show the value as text with one decimal point (e.g. 30.1, 25.0, etc) on the “Select a Value” screen


### Conclusion

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the answers.
